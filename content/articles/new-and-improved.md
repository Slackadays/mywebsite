After letting it sit for four years, my old hand-coded HTML website just wasn't cutting it. If you've never used such a setup before, this site from a bygone era consisted of HTML and CSS files, as well as the media assets referenced in those. It seemed like the perfect setup for something simple. And it was. But my needs grew out of the "simple" bucket, and so <a href="https://github.com/getzola/zola">Zola</a> became the next best thing.

Along with this rewrite came a style refresh. I realized that the old website's design arose from first writing CSS and seeing what the result was like. WRONG. Little did I know that you can create a much nicer website by first figuring out what you want it to look like and then writing the code to replicate that design. As a result, the layout is simpler, cleaner, and easier to use. What's not to like?
