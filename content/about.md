I'm a student at the University of Central Florida studying Photonics Science & Engineering along with Leadership and Math.

## High performance programming

C++ is my favorite programming language. I was only 8 years old when I found this incredible book called "C++11 Primer" and read the whole thing cover to cover. Although I didn't know how exactly to use all that knowledge then, today I do in my C++ software that thousands of people worldwide use.

## Trading

I first got into trading when I heard about Nvidia stock skyrocketing because of AI. However, due to some difficulties (to put it simply), I'm now far more interested in futures. I have the Series 3 futures license and want to register to be a CTA (Commodity Trading Advisor) soon.

## Music

When I was little, I learned to play the violin. Now, I've expanded into more musical territory including bass guitar, keyboard, and Dominican bachata. 

Check out one of my favorite bachata songs!
